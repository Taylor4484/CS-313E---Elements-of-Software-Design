<H3>The Assignment</H3>

This is a simple assignment designed to get you started in Python and
make sure that you can access the system and perform simple
operations.<P>

Write a program to prompt the user to type in a line of text at the
terminal.  You will do this repeatedly until
the user types an empty line.
For each line the user types, do each of the following:
<ol>
<li> display the line on the screen;
<li> display it again in all uppercase;
<li> display it again in all lowercase;
<li> count each letter a-z (in the lowercase version) and display the
  counts (ignore any non-letters); 
<li> display the line again using a Caesar Cipher to shift each letter
  (ignore non-letters)
  in the lowercase version by one character to the right (that is A
  goes to B, B goes to C, ..., Z goes to A).
</ol>
Design a pleasing looking output.  Below is what my program produced,
but you don't have to match that exactly.<P>

It took me about 15 minutes to write this program.  You may need
the Python functions <t>ord</t> and <t>chr</t>. <P>
