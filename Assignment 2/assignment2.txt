files, to be called Assignment2a.py and Assignment2b.py.  Make sure
that your picture persists on the screen for 20 seconds after the
drawing is finished. 
<ol>
<li> Use the turtle graphics module to draw a house with a door, two
  windows, and a chimney.  You can make it as detailed and colorful as
  you like.   

<li> Use the turtle graphics module to draw some interesting picture of
  your own choosing.  You will be judged on your creativity and
  execution. 
</ol>

Your program should run and draw the picture when the TA runs the
command <tt>python Assignment2a.py</tt> or <tt>python
  Assignment2b.py</tt>.
